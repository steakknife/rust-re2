Bindings for re2 for Rust

#Installing dependencies
Requires re2 and cre2.

```
cd deps && ./install_re2.sh && ./install_cre2.sh && cd ..
```

#Compiling
```
cd lib && make && cd ..
```

#Linking
```
rustc -L ../path/to/rust-re2/lib my_program.rs
```

It might be helpful to move the compiled lib to `/usr/local/lib` and link from
there.  I should add a `make install` target.

#Usage

```rust
let text = ~"hello world 42!";
let pattern = ~"(world), ([0-9]+)";
let mut matches: ~[~str] = re2::Matches::new(2u32);

re2::easy_match(pattern, text, matches);

matches[0]; // ~"world 42"
matches[1]; // ~"world"
matches[2]; // ~"42"
```

The `u32` passed to `re2::Matches::new` represents the number of groupings plus
one. Matches is always one more than the
number of groupings, as matches[0] is always the "full match".  The function
also returns `0i32` in the case of no match, `1i32` in the case of a match,
and `2i32` if the pattern is invalid.

This binding is incomplete, but has the basics working.  For more functions,
see test/test.rs.
